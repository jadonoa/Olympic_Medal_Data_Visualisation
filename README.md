# Olympic_Medal_Data_Visualisation
This project involves using an Olympic medal dataset to create visualisations using PowerBI. The dataset used has 2 million data entries but for the purpose of this project a sample of 1000 entries was taken. This was due to using the web version of PowerBI which is available to MacOS users.
